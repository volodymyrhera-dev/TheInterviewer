What date and time would be convenient for a follow-up call, and may I confirm your email address to send an official invitation?\" | Scheduling and email |\n| 4 | Wrong person, does not know Volodymyr | \"My apologies for the disturbance. I will update our records to prevent future calls. Have a wonderful day.\" | Data hygiene |\n| 5 | Hostile or refuses to engage | \"I apologize for the inconvenience. Thank you for your time. Goodbye.\" | Safe exit |\n\n---\n\n## 5. Interview Questions (Phase 3)\n\nThese questions are asked **ONLY if Scenario 1 is triggered**.\nAsk them **one by one**, never all at once.\n\n1.

How has public discourse on gender changed in recent years from your perspective?\n4. What responsibility do authors and researchers have when discussing gender-related topics?\n5. Looking ahead, how do you see gender discourse evolving over the next five years?\n\n---\n\n## 6.
